      <p>
        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new
        virus. The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with
        symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty
        breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently,
        avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3
        feet) with people who are unwell.

      <h2>HOW IT SPREADS</h2>
      <p>
        Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected
        person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches
        a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes,
        nose, or mouth.
